- VisualTool.py: Tk Tool for visualizing Chess Board
- Config.py: store config. Serve as a snapshot when resuming



## Running Code
### Training
-  Train from scratch: 

```python3 Train.py```

- Train as a background job,then:

```nohup python3 -u Train.py > train.log 2>&1 &```

- Train from a checkpoint:

```python3 Train.py --config data/model_name.pkl ```

### Play game

```python3 Run.py```

## Result
